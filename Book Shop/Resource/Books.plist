		<string>A journalist&apos;s powerful and incisive account of the forces steering the fate of his sprawling Filipino American family reframes how we comprehend the immigrant experience
Nearing the age at which his mother had migrated to the US, part of the wave of non-Europeans who arrived after immigration quotas were relaxed in 1965, Albert Samaha began to question the ironclad belief in a better future that had inspired her family to uproot themselves from their birthplace. </string>

Dawn, tall and studious; her sister, Kim, younger by three years and headstrong as they come; and her best friend, Debra, already prom-queen pretty by third grade. They bonded--fervently and intensely in that unique way of little girls--as they roamed the concrete landscape of Bronzeville, a historic neighborhood on Chicago&apos;s South Side, the destination of hundreds of thousands of Black folks who fled the ravages of the Jim Crow South.</string>

But when it became undeniable that something was seriously wrong, Miller gave in to family pressure and went to the hospital--beginning a years-long nightmare of procedures, misdiagnoses, and life-threatening infections.</string>

Miller examines the experience of discrimination through this silence and what it means to breach it -- &quot;to risk words, to risk truth; and through the body and the histories those bodies inherit&quot; the crimes that haunt them, and how the meanings of our bodies can shift as we move through the world, variously assuming privilege or victimhood.</string>

		<string>As this urgent, genre-defying book opens, a woman who has recently been elevated to prominence for her social media posts travels around the world to meet her adoring fans. She is overwhelmed by navigating the new language and etiquette of what she terms the portal, where she grapples with an unshakable conviction that a vast chorus of voices is now dictating her thoughts. When existential threats--from climate change and economic precariousness to the rise of an unnamed dictator and an epidemic of loneliness--begin to loom, she posts her way deeper into the portal&apos;s void. An avalanche of images, details, and references accumulate to form a landscape that is post-sense, post-irony, post-everything. Are we in hell? the people of the portal ask themselves. Are we all just going to keep doing this until we die?</string>

		<string>https://images-us.bookshop.org/ingram/9780156701600.jpg</string>
		<key>summary</key>
		<string>Virginia Woolf described &quot;Orlando&quot; as &quot;an escapade, half-laughing, half-serious; with great splashes of exaggeration, &quot; but many think Woolf&apos;s escapade is one of the most wickedly imaginative and sharply observed considerations of androgyny that this century will see.
Orlando is, in fact, a character liberated from the restraints of time and sex. Born in the Elizabethan Age to wealth and position, he is a young male aristocrat at the beginning of the story - and a modern woman four centuries later. The hero-heroine sees monarchs come and go, hobnobs with great literary figures, and slips in and out of each new fashion. Woolf presents a brilliant pageant of history, society, and literature as well as subtle appreciation of the interplay between endings and beginnings, past and present, male and female.</string>
